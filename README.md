Hi, I'm Edouard Paillard, former History teacher, reconverted into an informatician. I presently study at {EPITECH} Lille to improve the skills I worked on on my own for a few months. I have skills in Web development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, with a few frameworks here and there. We also learned about administration systems and networks which I found quite interesting.

I'll try to display my work here, hopping you'll appreciate.

Thanks for visiting.
