Hi, I'm Edouard Paillard, former History teacher, reconverted into an informatician. I presently study at {EPITECH} Lille to improve the skills I worked on on my own for a few months. I have skills in Web development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, with a few frameworks here and there. We also learned about administration systems and networks which I found quite interesting.

I'll try to display my work here, hopping you'll appreciate.

Thanks for visiting.

##Main focus
- If I'm honest, I appreciate basically everything I touched regarding informatic. I just started a job as linux administrator system, and I kinda like the DevOps orientation, so right now I'm mainly focusing on administration stuff.
- I'm still working on a personnal project [Bougainville](https://github.com/EdPaillard/BougainvilleStudio_v2), mainly using ReactJS and NodeJS.
- Last but not least, for the end-year project of Epitech, we'd like to develop a game using Unity, and, of course, I'd like a lot to develop my own game, with a lot of ideas to test.

##Learning
- For the current Epitech project, I'm learning PHP/Symfony as well as Angular and Typescript.
- For the game development, I'm learning C# and Unity
- For the Admin/DevOps thing, I'm focusing on Ansible, Kubernetes and Python.
